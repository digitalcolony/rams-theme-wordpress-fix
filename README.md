# Fix for Rams WordPress theme

Version 2.0.0 of the Rams Theme by Anders Nor√©n has an issue where the Previous and Next links do not show in the **POST META** section of a post.

I emailed the theme author with a detailed bug report. After waiting more than a month without receiving a response, I dusted off my PHP skills and fixed it myself.

To see the changes, compare singular.php with singular.phpORIGINAL.
